# ts-starter

An almost empty project with the skeleton structure for a typescript project. Specifically:
- tests
- code coverage
- ts watch/building
- ts linting
- types

## usage

- clone into/as a new project
- remove git remotes
- create a new repo (on github), update local remotes to point to it.

## structure

- src: where the typescript goes
- dist: where the transpiled js ends up
- test: tests... written in typescript saved as .spec.ts files

## commands

package.js scripts, run by `yarn [command]` or `npm run [command]`

- test
- build
- watch
- `coverage`: runs tests and displays code coverage
